# Clean Architecture Template
## How to use this template:
1. Download the CleanArchitecture.zip file
2. Create a new folder called Clean Architecture in the user project template directory for your version of Visual Studio. By default, this directory is %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio <version>\Templates\ProjectTemplates.
3. Copy the CleanArchitecture.zip file into the Clean Architecture folder you created and unzip the file.
4. You should now see a Clean Architecture option under the Visual C# section when you select NEW -> Project in Visual Studio.
